Australia is also introduced to a new kind of “violent love”, the Fight Hug.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250601025745 +0000" stop="20250601035302 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>This week contestants on Wipeout Australia are bought undone by a seemingly simple obstacle on the Qualifier, the Slippery Stairs. It’s all in the name really, an innocent set of stairs, covered in Wipeout Crash cream. Its up the way and down the way for all and sundry. The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies. Look out for Scotty Six Toes at the Big Balls and get the ear plugs ready as you meet Herr Chris. It’s a colourful week with leotards, laughs and lots of ladies.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250601035302 +0000" stop="20250601044554 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>It’s Sitcom Central on Wipeout Australia with the Odd Couple, starring World’s Strongest Dwarf, David Clarke and Gentle Giant, Tim Watts.

Chance and Ashleigh Eckert are on their first out-of-state hunt in the rolling hills of Ohio. After overcoming a life-changing kidney transplant, their story is one of faith, love, and resilience. While the goal was a big buck, the true reward was the time spent together and the lessons learned along the way. Because hunting is about so much more than the harvest — it’s about the journey.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250601023000 +0000" stop="20250601030000 +0000"><title>The Huntsman</title><desc>Ask any mature hunter and you'll hear the same answer: the joy you feel when you witness your friend having successfully hunted an animal is far greater than the joy you would have felt had you been the one to pull the trigger. The reason for this selflessness goes deep into the roots of what drives hunters to hunt.In this episode of The Huntsman Chris and KC are back for another Australian hunting adventure. Continuing off the back of their successful camel hunt it's KC's turn to fill the freezer and he's got his sights set on both wild goat and rusa deer. In these moments, the joy comes from knowing you've played a part in someone else's achievement. It's a selfless joy that resonates deeper and lasts longer. This is what makes hunting more than just a sport—it's a way of life that fosters respect, gratitude, and an enduring sense of community.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250601030000 +0000" stop="20250601033000 +0000"><title>The Raven Project</title><desc>From the ground up host Randy Birdsong will take you through the trials and tribulations of owning his first farm and grooming it to be one of the best whitetail hunting properties in the country</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250601033000 +0000" stop="20250601040001 +0000"><title>Behind The Draw</title><desc>The Missouri River Breaks of Montana is an amazing place to hunt elk that we are no stranger to.

The reason for this selflessness goes deep into the roots of what drives hunters to hunt.In this episode of The Huntsman Chris and KC are back for another Australian hunting adventure. Continuing off the back of their successful camel hunt it's KC's turn to fill the freezer and he's got his sights set on both wild goat and rusa deer. In these moments, the joy comes from knowing you've played a part in someone else's achievement. It's a selfless joy that resonates deeper and lasts longer. This is what makes hunting more than just a sport—it's a way of life that fosters respect, gratitude, and an enduring sense of community.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250601030000 +0000" stop="20250601033000 +0000"><title>The Raven Project</title><desc>From the ground up host Randy Birdsong will take you through the trials and tribulations of owning his first farm and grooming it to be one of the best whitetail hunting properties in the country</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250601033000 +0000" stop="20250601040001 +0000"><title>Behind The Draw</title><desc>The Missouri River Breaks of Montana is an amazing place to hunt elk that we are no stranger to.

When Barnaby and Jones investigate to determine who wanted Hopkirk dead, they find out that he secretly came to the village under various aliases for sexual rendezvous with various women in fantasy role-playing scenarios, and that he had been making further investigations on the future development site and having doubts over claims it was contaminated. Either someone didn't like his investigations, or someone didn't like his sexual appetite, but either way, Barnaby finds himself investigating lies and more to uncover the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250601082600 +0000" stop="20250601101300 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby and DC Ben Jones (Jason Hughes) find themselves attempting to unravel the deaths of a choir tenor, and later a bird watcher, before more murders occur. The case is complicated by a rivalry between the Midsomer Worthy and Aston Wherry choirs, due to compete in an upcoming competition, and suspicions that an art scam is to be conducted, and soon Barnaby and Jones become concerned about a local woman, who they fear may become a victim herself.

Her time in court has come, but DCI Barnaby is certain she still is holding things back in regards to the murder, and decides to monitor the trial. Yet a chance remark by Frances' youngest daughter, and a meeting with an old friend and psychiatrist, makes him begin to doubt the evidence for her conviction. Soon he and DC Jones, awaiting news of his promotion to DS, find themselves reinvestigating the case, and it soon becomes clear that they may have missed details that could implicate another in the murder.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250601120000 +0000" stop="20250601134400 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The residents of Milton Cross, a feudal estate with a church, farms, houses and acres of land, depend on lord of the manor Edward Milton for their livelihoods. But when Sonia Woodley is stabbed in the churchyard two years after the death of her abusive husband Gerald, Barnaby and Jones investigate, trying to work out who killed her. It soon becomes clear someone took a pair of tailor scissors to do the deed, but who amongst the villagers could have done so, is unclear, and the investigation is complicated, when the pair learn the local Anglican priest, the parish vicar, had received a letter from Sonia. When he himself is killed, the pair believe something in the letter may be key to solving the mystery.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250601134400 +0000" stop="20250601152900 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby is not convinced about Mayor David Hicks' plans to revive an annual trip to Brighton, suspecting his proposal to buy coastal land there, is rather a fraudulent scheme.

It is the prime example of HOW NOT TO RUN A RESTAURANT. Owner DAVE is the flakey self-appointed head chef, who hasn't been in a kitchen for 30 years and can't cook. His partner DAWN invents bizarre dishes for the menu, ranging from "tomato and cointreau soup" to "pork with brie, nectarine and whiskey sauce".

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250601135500 +0000" stop="20250601145100 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>It's Halloween weekend, and the squad tackle an assault on a nightclub bouncer.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250601145100 +0000" stop="20250601154700 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>Officers get revenge on the irritating Kennett.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250601154700 +0000" stop="20250601164300 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>Kennett's harassment charges are investigated.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250601164300 +0000" stop="20250601173900 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>Fly along with helicopter doctors and paramedics of the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, where cutting-edge modern emergency medicine saves lives every day.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250601173900 +0000" stop="20250601183400 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>Fly along with helicopter doctors and paramedics of the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, where cutting-edge modern emergency medicine saves lives every day.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250601183400 +0000" stop="20250601192900 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>In Bradford, a man critically injured in a hit-and-run accident gives a difficult case to Dr. Tim.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250601192900 +0000" stop="20250601203000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Gordon last left Laurence knowing that he had simplified his menu to have clean, simple, honest, traditional food using local produce.

Before long, Barnaby and Jones are heading to Wales - former home to Delyth Mostyn, James's fiancee, to delve deeper into the mystery. There are certainly possible suspects in the murder and attempt on Kirkwood, from Delyth's children, who oppose the engagement, Delyth's husband, and more, as the detectives investigate things, in hopes of uncovering the truth before a major walk is to take place on Mount Snowdon.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250601080000 +0000" stop="20250601100000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>In the build-up to Luxton Deeping's annual photographic exhibition, a battle rages between the traditional and digital photographers of the pretty village. The dispute seems harmless enough - until Lionel Bell is found murdered in a nearby woodland, strangled with the cord of his light meter. Barnaby soon gets to work tracking down the killer, but it seems someone is trying to implicate the detective in the murder. And once he is replaced on the case, finding the culprit seems less likely than ever, as his replacement is more concerned of an upcoming wedding than the investigation. Barnaby is forced to work off the case to uncover who is framing him, and who wants dead other photographers in the village.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250601100000 +0000" stop="20250601110000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch investigates the death of an elderly groom;

We visit a stone masonry school where students turn white limestone into beautiful works of art.</desc></programme><programme channel="687451" start="20250601140000 +0000" stop="20250601143000 +0000"><title>Rt 66: Missouri</title><desc>A Photowalk along historic Route 66 continues in Missouri, where Jefferson Graham takes you to some of the most beautiful and unique places to explore.</desc></programme><programme channel="687451" start="20250601143000 +0000" stop="20250601150000 +0000"><title>Rt 66: Chicago</title><desc>A Photowalk along historic Route 66 begins in Chicago, where Jefferson Graham takes you to some of the most beautiful and unique places to explore.</desc></programme><programme channel="687451" start="20250601150000 +0000" stop="20250601153000 +0000"><title>Ketamine: From Street Drug To Lifesaver</title><desc>Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death in the world for those aged 15-24 years.
