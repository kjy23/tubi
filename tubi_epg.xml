Whether they’re breaking ice on Green Bay to chase trophy walleye or traveling up to the Northwoods to carry on years of family traditions, Kaitlin and Josh Woodward embody a passion for fishing in its truest form. After fishing together for nearly 11 years, the Woodwards started a part-time guiding business in 2019 called Woodward Fishing to share their passion for their own Wisconsin waters. Some of Kaitlin’s favorite memories on the water have been in Green Bay chasing trophy fish; she recounts, “Every cast was a pre-spawn 25” -27” walleye; it was unreal.” Their teamwork and drive on the water are unmatched. Josh brings his determination to find the fish, and Kaitlin brings her tenacity and ability to get everyone back to the purity of nature no matter what the day brings.They have guided together for the past four years in the Northwoods of Wisconsin and Green Bay, and both areas hold an equally special place for the Woodwards. Josh cut his teeth fishing in Green Bay and Sturgeon Bay with his grandfather and grew up going to the Northwoods with his family. These traditions have become a way of life for Josh and Kaitlin as their year revolves around making the most of the season in both locations with their favorite boat dog, Kimber, in tow. “My family was here before my time, and now we’re going to pass that on to our kids.” – Josh WoodwardFollow their adventures as they put AFTCO fishing rain gear to the test in our newest AFTCO Original Film, “Up North.”</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250612060030 +0000" stop="20250612063026 +0000"><title>Sportsman's Journal</title><desc>The SJTV crew head to famous Lake Vermilion in Northern Minnesota to chase after the fabled Muskies at Everett Bay Lodge!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250612063026 +0000" stop="20250612070022 +0000"><title>Sportsman's Journal</title><desc>Tyler and Sara pitch leeches for shallow water walleyes in tough conditions.

Whether they’re breaking ice on Green Bay to chase trophy walleye or traveling up to the Northwoods to carry on years of family traditions, Kaitlin and Josh Woodward embody a passion for fishing in its truest form. After fishing together for nearly 11 years, the Woodwards started a part-time guiding business in 2019 called Woodward Fishing to share their passion for their own Wisconsin waters. Some of Kaitlin’s favorite memories on the water have been in Green Bay chasing trophy fish; she recounts, “Every cast was a pre-spawn 25” -27” walleye; it was unreal.” Their teamwork and drive on the water are unmatched. Josh brings his determination to find the fish, and Kaitlin brings her tenacity and ability to get everyone back to the purity of nature no matter what the day brings.They have guided together for the past four years in the Northwoods of Wisconsin and Green Bay, and both areas hold an equally special place for the Woodwards. Josh cut his teeth fishing in Green Bay and Sturgeon Bay with his grandfather and grew up going to the Northwoods with his family. These traditions have become a way of life for Josh and Kaitlin as their year revolves around making the most of the season in both locations with their favorite boat dog, Kimber, in tow. “My family was here before my time, and now we’re going to pass that on to our kids.” – Josh WoodwardFollow their adventures as they put AFTCO fishing rain gear to the test in our newest AFTCO Original Film, “Up North.”</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250612060030 +0000" stop="20250612063026 +0000"><title>Sportsman's Journal</title><desc>The SJTV crew head to famous Lake Vermilion in Northern Minnesota to chase after the fabled Muskies at Everett Bay Lodge!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250612063026 +0000" stop="20250612070022 +0000"><title>Sportsman's Journal</title><desc>Tyler and Sara pitch leeches for shallow water walleyes in tough conditions.

Geoffrey is soon gashed to death after a cricket match in Midsomer Parva, and the locals blame the 'beast of Midsomer'. However, Barnaby - a former spy himself - soon realises that the killing has links to Allenby House and Cold War Berlin, but is initially thrown off the case by MI6. But when a further murder occurs MI6 Agent Glen Jarvis (Neil Stuke) asks Barnaby back on the case.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250613184700 +0000" stop="20250613203900 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Midsomer University science fellow and cycling enthusiast George Jeffers (David Haig) threatens to make public a problem with his state-of-the-art invention Kernel Logic, but American software boss Clinton Finn fears he will lose millions if the truth comes out. When a schoolteacher is killed in a hit-and-run, Barnaby suspects Jeffers was the intended target. The subsequent murder of a fellow cyclist (Philip Jackson) brings the involvement of fellow University associates (Jonathan Cecil and Jim Norton) into sharper focus.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250613203900 +0000" stop="20250613222700 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>In the peaceful village of Little Worthy, Bob Moss was about to open up his beloved model village, when he found a gruesome extra attraction.

His partner DAWN invents bizarre dishes for the menu, ranging from "tomato and cointreau soup" to "pork with brie, nectarine and whiskey sauce".

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250612221700 +0000" stop="20250612230900 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Starkville, Mississippi to try to rescue the failing Hotel Chester.

It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's
