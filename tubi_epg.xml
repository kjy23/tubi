Unbeknownst to the killers, a secret video surveillance camera recorded the shooting.

The appointments secretary to the Governor had carried on an illicit affair with a wealthy married man.  Agents suspected that her powerful ex-lover was responsible, but they had little physical evidence to support their theory.  Investigators never found the woman's body or the murder weapon.

The kidnappers contact the victim's family and demand $30,000, but offer no instructions on how to transfer the money.  The victim's family contacts the police.  The boy's captors tell his family they have shot him, and will kill him if they do not receive their money.

For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250609024700 +0000" stop="20250609034700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250609034700 +0000" stop="20250609044600 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's first programme is Ruby Tates in Brighton, owned and run by ex-actor and failed Hollywood wannabe ALLAN LOVE.

Despite a ~500k refurbishment and décor like a Bollywood set the honeymoon period's well and truly over.

Ex Royal Marine pilot Harry swoops on a street in Castleford to drop his medics next to an unconscious cyclist feared to have a brain injury. Paramedics Sammy and Ady find themselves dealing with a difficult patient who insists he wants to climb back on his badly damaged motorbike thanks to bizarre effects of a head injury sustained in the accident. Flying doctor Jez is confronted by a baffling whodunnit after a man is accidentally shot at a firing range. A jockey thrown by his galloping horse amazes the team with his toughness as he undergoes treatment on a broken bone without even flinching. Meanwhile, a crash outside one of Yorkshire’s most famous stately homes leaves a man with a chronic medical condition trapped in his upturned car. On the moors, paramedics Pete and Lee rescue an off road biker injured when his motorcycle toppled off a rock.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250609163300 +0000" stop="20250609173000 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>The crew of Helimed 98 call in a flying doctor to perform a complex medical procedure in a country lane after a cyclist is left fighting for her life.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250609173000 +0000" stop="20250609182700 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage attempts to recover two 16-ton sections of a bridge washed away in heavy flooding.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250609182700 +0000" stop="20250609192300 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage heads to the Northern Territory for a time-critical beach recovery.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250609192300 +0000" stop="20250609201900 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage joins forces with Darwin's Harbour Master to clear the area's waterways of toxic and hazardous wrecks.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250609201900 +0000" stop="20250609212000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron. Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure.

To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains.

Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250609232000 +0000" stop="20250610001200 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay visits a “Caribbean” style resort hotel in Fort Pierce, Florida where the young inexperienced owner, Brian is making guests’ time at the hotel miserable with filthy rooms, late night concerts and shocking service.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250610001200 +0000" stop="20250610010300 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Island Park, Idaho to try and rescue the failing Angler’s Lodge.

In a small Ohio community, an elderly woman and a teenage boy disappeared within hours of each other.  Police believed the cases were linked, but didn't know how. They contacted the FBI for help.  A trail of stolen vehicles and murder victims across seven states led agents on a hunt for two suspected killers. Their only hope of stopping them was to anticipate the killers' next move.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250610131600 +0000" stop="20250610141300 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In Kokomo, Indiana an unthinkable crime terrified residents. A young woman was snatched from her home on a bright spring morning.

Fifty blue acrylic fibers collected during a search of Hughes' car, however, became the major piece of evidence in the case.
