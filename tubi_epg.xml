Contestants are armed with Dodgeballs, to be deployed at each other, creating horrific hits and spectacular spills.

A former waitress at the restaurant, Rachel bought it three years ago and now, along with best friend Stephanie, she's trying to convert the carnivorous French into a nation of veggies. For Gordon it's a sentimental journey to the city where he spent his formative years as a chef, a food mecca full of gastronomic delights that should be a dream.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250604043600 +0000" stop="20250604053600 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's penultimate programme is The Curry Lounge in Nottingham, the city with more restaurants per square mile than any other in Britain. This 120-seater Indian restaurant has been run since January by ex sales director Raz who's new to the business - and it shows. Despite a ~500k refurbishment and décor like a Bollywood set the honeymoon period's well and truly over. His once-healthy trade is evaporating and at his current rate of loss it's uncertain he'll make it past Christmas.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250604053600 +0000" stop="20250604063700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's final programme is The Granary in rural Hampshire, an upmarket restaurant which - at 200 seats - is the biggest Gordon's ever taken on. Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250604063700 +0000" stop="20250604073700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron. Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure. Every night they go twelve rounds with the local clientele who are fast deserting them to the tune of a ~£1,000 per week loss.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250604073700 +0000" stop="20250604083400 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>Marie ended up being rushed into hospital when surgery to remove excess skin left her with life threatening sepsis.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250604083400 +0000" stop="20250604093200 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>Sue's 'cut price' tummy tuck in Turkey almost killed her and Oli's quest to become a Korean pop star led him to spend £100,000 to look like his Asian idols.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250604093200 +0000" stop="20250604102900 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>A firsthand account of so-called 'Botox Parties'.

The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains.

The restaurant is on its last legs - they've run out of customers, money and hope. Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250604200200 +0000" stop="20250604210300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>When 21 year old chef Tim sold "fine dining" to Bonapartes bistro, they assumed he could cook.
