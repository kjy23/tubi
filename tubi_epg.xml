Owned by multi-millionaire Barry Larson and costing ~£8000 a week to run, the place boasts top French chef Loic Lefebvre and an impeccably-trained kitchen staff with Michelin star-studded backgrounds. Loic is on a mission, to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of haggis, tatties and deep-fried Mars bars. But though he's hungry for success, he's French, he's arrogant and the food's pretentious.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250520204400 +0000" stop="20250520214400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's program is Clubway 41, despite being voted Blackpool Tourist Board Restaurant of the year, the place is dire straits. It is the prime example of HOW NOT TO RUN A RESTAURANT. Owner DAVE is the flakey self-appointed head chef, who hasn't been in a kitchen for 30 years and can't cook. His partner DAWN invents bizarre dishes for the menu, ranging from "tomato and cointreau soup" to "pork with brie, nectarine and whiskey sauce".

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250520224500 +0000" stop="20250520234500 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Jay saves Luke's bacon with a polished portrait; Sketch beautifies Mark's belly Buddha.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250520234500 +0000" stop="20250521004300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Alice tackles Beverley's backside blunder; Jay wipes Bailey's holiday Poomoji tatt clean.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250521004300 +0000" stop="20250521014300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>John's tattoo is on another planet, while Alec has made a big mistake with a tiny inking.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250521014300 +0000" stop="20250521024200 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Jay gives Ian a portrait that has to be seen to be believed and Alice covers Linsey's scar.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250521024200 +0000" stop="20250521034100 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Belieber Nathan decides it's time for Sketch to rid him of his embarrassing fan tattoo.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250521034100 +0000" stop="20250521044300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's program Gordon Ramsay travels to the seaside to help ailing hotel and restaurant, The Sandgate.
