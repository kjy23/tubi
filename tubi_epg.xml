Captain Russell was a dedicated officer; her friends and colleagues were certain she had not gone AWOL.  FBI agents found her husband, a former Marine, was acting strangely, and a blood-like stain on the couple's floor disappeared before agents could examine it.  There was no body, no witness and no weapon.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250611170500 +0000" stop="20250611180300 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>Residents of the small town of Noel, Missouri were shocked when one of their banks was robbed.  When the bank president was nowhere to be found, the residents were outraged.  The FBI discovered that things are not always as they appear.  Minute clues led the agents to the body of the bank president.  With no suspects, the FBI relied on dogged determination and modern forensics.

After an officer was gunned down at point-blank range, the psychotic killer led investigators across the Midwest. No one knew where the gunman would strike next, even as his tally of murders and abductions grew. The FBI and state police raced against time to rescue America's heartland from this deranged gunman, before he killed again.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250611185900 +0000" stop="20250611195600 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>A stranger snatched an eight-year-old girl as she played in her Tucson, Arizona neighborhood, leaving behind an abandoned bicycle and a frantic mother.

Barnaby and Jones discover that the victim was poisoned with a rare toxin extracted from Ecuadorean poison frogs - so the hunt is on for a particularly ruthless and imaginative killer. The detectives soon learn that a feud is raging between local occult practitioner Ernest Balliol and famous writer Aloysius Wilmington. While some of the villagers - such as Ernest's daughter Isolde - believe that powerful magical forces are at play, others think the reasons for the bloodshed may have their roots in the distant past. Barnaby and Jones soon find themselves delving into the occult, magic, and ancients books of power, to determine what happened, and soon sense a mixture of both might be the motive for the murder, when a book shop owner is killed with shattered glass, laced in the same poison.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250611080000 +0000" stop="20250611100000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby and Jones are forced to take part in a team building exercise and Tom has plenty of problems dealing with the young, new, acting Chief Superintendent, John Cotton (Nick Fletcher). Following an explosion in a truck that had been stored in a truck depot, a body is soon discovered in a nearby lake, which turns out to be Alec Grainger, who had been seen arguing with James Parkes (Joseph Millson), the son of Colonel Matt Parkes (Tim Pigott-Smith). James appears to be involved in shady business deals and is blamed by his grandmother Caroline Halsey (Judy Parfitt) - and others - for the suicide of a woman he got pregnant two years before. Barnaby and Jones find themselves delving into a mixture of fraud, smuggling, and lies, trying to piece together the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250611100000 +0000" stop="20250611110000 +0000"><title>The Listener</title><desc>Oz puts his life in danger after asking Toby to help an old friend who witnessed a murder.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250611110000 +0000" stop="20250611120000 +0000"><title>The Listener</title><desc>The team must prove Michelle was set up after a suspect is shot.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250611120000 +0000" stop="20250611130000 +0000"><title>The Listener</title><desc>Toby and Michelle investigate a string of high-tech thefts in Vancouver.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250611130000 +0000" stop="20250611140000 +0000"><title>The Listener</title><desc>Toby and Michelle search for a dangerous gang while feeling the pressure of the new police superintendent.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250611140000 +0000" stop="20250611150000 +0000"><title>The Listener</title><desc>When Tia's colleague is targeted by a hotel owner, Toby pushes for an investigation.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250611150000 +0000" stop="20250611160000 +0000"><title>The Listener</title><desc>Toby and Michelle search for a killer suspected of taking national defense secrets.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250611160000 +0000" stop="20250611170000 +0000"><title>The Listener</title><desc>Toby goes under cover to find a group of thieves posing as police officers.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250611170000 +0000" stop="20250611180000 +0000"><title>MacGyver</title><desc>After a surprising introduction to Phoenix's newest recruit, Desi, MacGyver and team are assigned to protect a gun-sniffing dog who has a bounty on its head.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250611180000 +0000" stop="20250611190000 +0000"><title>MacGyver</title><desc>The Phoenix must recover the body of a pilot whose plane crashed while testing an experimental laser mapping system that MacGyver designed; Riley tries to identify the hacker who tricked a SWAT team into arresting her and Elwood.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250611190000 +0000" stop="20250611200000 +0000"><title>MacGyver</title><desc>MacGyver and the team are asked to solve a locked-door mystery when a man working inside a remote, ultra-secure international seed vault disappears.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250611200000 +0000" stop="20250611210000 +0000"><title>MacGyver</title><desc>When Nicholas Helman resurfaces to carry out a killing spree, the team is forced to get help from the one person who knows him best -- his protégé, Murdoc.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250611210000 +0000" stop="20250611220000 +0000"><title>MacGyver</title><desc>MacGyver and Desi help a group of Syrian refugees who are being pursued by human traffickers; Bozer is trapped in Oversight's car, and it's rigged to explode.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250611220000 +0000" stop="20250611230000 +0000"><title>MacGyver</title><desc>Two American tourists go missing while doing a scavenger hunt through some of the world's most dangerous countries; the Phoenix team goes under cover as backpackers to find them and bring them home alive.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250611230000 +0000" stop="20250612000000 +0000"><title>MacGyver</title><desc>A cunning new adversary's carefully crafted plans force Mac to make an impossible choice: save the life of a friend or save the lives of hundreds of innocents; Mac receives new information that will drive a wedge between him and his father.</desc></programme><channel id="715943"><display-name>Watchlist</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/ReMaTAHgfGzsjA==/3f255caf-ac21-456a-add4-31745babe3cb/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjZAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="715943" start="20250610012119 +0000" stop="20250610024407 +0000"><title>Westworld</title><desc>In the season three finale, it's time to face the music.</desc></programme><programme channel="715943" start="20250610024407 +0000" stop="20250610034539 +0000"><title>Westworld</title><desc>Hello again.
