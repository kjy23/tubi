When the post mortem confirms her death was no accident, the pair discover that nothing is what it seems to be within the little village as they try to find out what exactly she saw. Their investigation introduces Barnaby and Troy to many eccentric and quirky residents and soon turns up a web of sex, blackmail and lies, and the possibility that the murder could be connected to a shooting accident two years ago, which claimed another woman's life.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250618034000 +0000" stop="20250618054300 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>After debating on who their next guest speaker should be, the Midsomer Worthy Writers' Circle decide to invite famous writer, Max Jennings, to their next meeting, despite opposition to the choice by Gerald Hadleigh, the group's chairman.

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250617221000 +0000" stop="20250617230500 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Harry wants a memorial tattoo dedicated to a very intimate body part after surviving testicular cancer;

For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250618201600 +0000" stop="20250618211600 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool.

The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele.

Since the beginning, the FBI had been analyzing the crime scene evidence and had found a common link: red trilobal carpet fibers.  But there was no suspect, until one of the killer's potential victims survived.  Through her interviews and the cooperation of local authorities and the FBI, 31-year-old Bobby Joe Long emerged as the prime suspect.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250618103700 +0000" stop="20250618113300 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In November of 1994, when a Wells Fargo armored van disappeared from a Glendale, Arizona mall, local authorities and the FBI scrambled to recover it, and its cargo of nearly a million dollars.

It marked the beginning of a four-year crime wave that rocked Seattle.  With each new robbery, the bandits perfected their craft, leaving behind no evidence and escaping with hundreds and thousands of dollars.  As the robbers became increasingly violent, pressure mounted to end their reign.  With few leads, the FBI forced their own luck.  The effort put them face to face with an armed and desperate fugitive.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250618123000 +0000" stop="20250618133000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>He was a recluse who spread terror through the mail for 18 years.
