He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250601230000 +0000" stop="20250602000000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</desc></programme><channel id="685557"><display-name>Jamie Oliver</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/vzcpEKO218Lk8Q==/bb725ad2-1855-4a84-bfa6-a0b7ea8482c4/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjZAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="685557" start="20250531012523 +0000" stop="20250531015337 +0000"><title>Jamie's 30 Minute Meals</title><desc>Jamie makes cauliflower macaroni, chicory salad with 'insane dressing', followed by stewed fruit.</desc></programme><programme channel="685557" start="20250531015337 +0000" stop="20250531022139 +0000"><title>Jamie's 30 Minute Meals</title><desc>Jamie shows how to prepare foccacia stuffed with prosciutto and celeriac remoulade.</desc></programme><programme channel="685557" start="20250531022139 +0000" stop="20250531024958 +0000"><title>Jamie's 30 Minute Meals</title><desc>Jamie Oliver shows how to make Moroccan lamb chops, served with flatbreads</desc></programme><programme channel="685557" start="20250531024958 +0000" stop="20250531031746 +0000"><title>Jamie's 30 Minute Meals</title><desc>Jamie prepares sea bass and crispy pancetta, sweet potato mash, asian greens, and berry ice cream.</desc></programme><programme channel="685557" start="20250531031746 +0000" stop="20250531034557 +0000"><title>Jamie's 30 Minute Meals</title><desc>Jamie makes summer veg lasagne, Tuscan tomato salad and quick mango frozen yoghurt in baby cornets.</desc></programme><programme channel="685557" start="20250531034557 +0000" stop="20250531041354 +0000"><title>Jamie's 30 Minute Meals</title><desc>Jamie prepares smoky haddock corn chowder, spiced tiger prawns, and a rainbow salad.</desc></programme><programme channel="685557" start="20250531041354 +0000" stop="20250531044229 +0000"><title>Oliver's Twist</title><desc>London is a larder.

The reason for this selflessness goes deep into the roots of what drives hunters to hunt.In this episode of The Huntsman Chris and KC are back for another Australian hunting adventure. Continuing off the back of their successful camel hunt it's KC's turn to fill the freezer and he's got his sights set on both wild goat and rusa deer. In these moments, the joy comes from knowing you've played a part in someone else's achievement. It's a selfless joy that resonates deeper and lasts longer. This is what makes hunting more than just a sport—it's a way of life that fosters respect, gratitude, and an enduring sense of community.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250601030000 +0000" stop="20250601033000 +0000"><title>The Raven Project</title><desc>From the ground up host Randy Birdsong will take you through the trials and tribulations of owning his first farm and grooming it to be one of the best whitetail hunting properties in the country</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250601033000 +0000" stop="20250601040001 +0000"><title>Behind The Draw</title><desc>The Missouri River Breaks of Montana is an amazing place to hunt elk that we are no stranger to.

The reason for this selflessness goes deep into the roots of what drives hunters to hunt.In this episode of The Huntsman Chris and KC are back for another Australian hunting adventure. Continuing off the back of their successful camel hunt it's KC's turn to fill the freezer and he's got his sights set on both wild goat and rusa deer. In these moments, the joy comes from knowing you've played a part in someone else's achievement. It's a selfless joy that resonates deeper and lasts longer. This is what makes hunting more than just a sport—it's a way of life that fosters respect, gratitude, and an enduring sense of community.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250601030000 +0000" stop="20250601033000 +0000"><title>The Raven Project</title><desc>From the ground up host Randy Birdsong will take you through the trials and tribulations of owning his first farm and grooming it to be one of the best whitetail hunting properties in the country</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250601033000 +0000" stop="20250601040001 +0000"><title>Behind The Draw</title><desc>The Missouri River Breaks of Montana is an amazing place to hunt elk that we are no stranger to.

York. City. That’s where our host Josh Rosen kicks off his journey in Episode 4—and where he lived for 16 years and started up the surf-centric apparel brand, Saturdays NYC. Back in his old stomping grounds, Josh first meets up with the award-winning chef and Mumbai native, Chintan Pandya, currently blowing up the New York food scene with his unapologetic and authentic Indian cuisine (pro tip: try the goat brains). Next, Josh travels through the boroughs, heads upstate, and along the coast to source local ingredients—from sake brewers and pig farmers to catching fresh lobster just 100 miles from Wall Street.

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250601135500 +0000" stop="20250601145100 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>It's Halloween weekend, and the squad tackle an assault on a nightclub bouncer.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250601145100 +0000" stop="20250601154700 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>Officers get revenge on the irritating Kennett.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250601154700 +0000" stop="20250601164300 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>Kennett's harassment charges are investigated.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250601164300 +0000" stop="20250601173900 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>Fly along with helicopter doctors and paramedics of the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, where cutting-edge modern emergency medicine saves lives every day.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250601173900 +0000" stop="20250601183400 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>Fly along with helicopter doctors and paramedics of the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, where cutting-edge modern emergency medicine saves lives every day.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250601183400 +0000" stop="20250601192900 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>In Bradford, a man critically injured in a hit-and-run accident gives a difficult case to Dr. Tim.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250601192900 +0000" stop="20250601203000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Gordon last left Laurence knowing that he had simplified his menu to have clean, simple, honest, traditional food using local produce.

The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250601213000 +0000" stop="20250601223000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250601223000 +0000" stop="20250601233000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250601233000 +0000" stop="20250602002900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's first programme is Ruby Tates in Brighton, owned and run by ex-actor and failed Hollywood wannabe ALLAN LOVE.

Before long, Barnaby and Jones are heading to Wales - former home to Delyth Mostyn, James's fiancee, to delve deeper into the mystery. There are certainly possible suspects in the murder and attempt on Kirkwood, from Delyth's children, who oppose the engagement, Delyth's husband, and more, as the detectives investigate things, in hopes of uncovering the truth before a major walk is to take place on Mount Snowdon.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250601080000 +0000" stop="20250601100000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>In the build-up to Luxton Deeping's annual photographic exhibition, a battle rages between the traditional and digital photographers of the pretty village. The dispute seems harmless enough - until Lionel Bell is found murdered in a nearby woodland, strangled with the cord of his light meter. Barnaby soon gets to work tracking down the killer, but it seems someone is trying to implicate the detective in the murder. And once he is replaced on the case, finding the culprit seems less likely than ever, as his replacement is more concerned of an upcoming wedding than the investigation. Barnaby is forced to work off the case to uncover who is framing him, and who wants dead other photographers in the village.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250601100000 +0000" stop="20250601110000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch investigates the death of an elderly groom; Crabtree meets Lucy Maud Montgomery at a writing class.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250601110000 +0000" stop="20250601120000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>The new chief constable pressures Murdoch to make an arrest when a man is murdered in a church.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250601120000 +0000" stop="20250601130000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch investigates a murder linked to a feral young woman.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250601130000 +0000" stop="20250601140000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch goes under cover to investigate the murder of a reporter who was investigating a workhouse.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250601140000 +0000" stop="20250601150000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch and Brackenreid risk their careers to investigate police corruption.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250601150000 +0000" stop="20250601160000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch and Brackenreid investigate a shooting in Buffalo.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250601160000 +0000" stop="20250601170000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>The return of an adversary threatens the lives of Murdoch and Ogden.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250601170000 +0000" stop="20250601180000 +0000"><title>48 Hours</title><desc>A woman turns to a private eye for help tracking down a Russian whom she believes robbed and killed her mother.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250601180000 +0000" stop="20250601190000 +0000"><title>48 Hours</title><desc>The investigation into the death of a woman's husband reveals he is not the first man she married who died under suspicious circumstances.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250601190000 +0000" stop="20250601200000 +0000"><title>48 Hours</title><desc>The investigation into the shooting death of retired NYPD officer Patrick Gilhuley, including interviews with jury members and a deconstruction of forensic evidence.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250601200000 +0000" stop="20250601210000 +0000"><title>48 Hours</title><desc>A New York dentist denies killing his lover's husband -- who was also his best friend.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250601210000 +0000" stop="20250601220000 +0000"><title>48 Hours</title><desc>New information in the case of a woman accused of killing her fiance during a kayaking trip may prove her innocence.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250601220000 +0000" stop="20250601230000 +0000"><title>48 Hours</title><desc>An $800,000 business deal between an entrepreneur and a Silicon Valley businessman looking to invest in the Napa Valley wine scene ends in murder.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250601230000 +0000" stop="20250602000000 +0000"><title>48 Hours</title><desc>An Oregon man who was accused of pushing his fiancée off a cliff during a hike tells his side of the story.</desc></programme><channel id="715943"><display-name>Watchlist</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/ReMaTAHgfGzsjA==/3f255caf-ac21-456a-add4-31745babe3cb/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjZAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="715943" start="20250531013812 +0000" stop="20250531024235 +0000"><title>Westworld</title><desc>Like what I've done with the place?
