Naturally, he joins the trip, but during their time in Brighton, a hated property developer (Tim McInnerny) is beheaded on a ghost house ride, prompting Barnaby to team up with his cousin to determine whether the developer's renters, the mayor, a gloomy reverend (Mark Gatiss), or the lady of a large estate are responsible, and soon discovers a hotbed of jealously, debt, lies and more, conceal a far darker secret.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250617061500 +0000" stop="20250617080000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Ford Florey is a town with a Wild West Society and many grudges.

When Barnaby and Jones start investigating the possible drowning, they discover unsavoury connections to the past that could prove lethal 20 years later, especially when someone attempts to kill. It isn't long, before murder does occur, and the detectives attempt to fathom what occurred in the drowning, and the present day murders.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250617112900 +0000" stop="20250617131400 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When Midsomer Morchard's very own boxer, John Kinsella, wins a world title in New York, the success seems to be a joyous time for all, until murder rears its ugly head.

Meanwhile Kinsella's trainer Teddy Molloy (Phil Daniels) has his own hidden agenda. When a re-enactment of a Victorian boxing match gets heated, and Kinsella's manager is found dead in his home's gym, the pair attempt to determine who is responsible, although Barnaby's judgement seems to be clouded on this one.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250617131400 +0000" stop="20250617145900 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>A planning dispute turns to murder, after a leading light in the Midsomer Conservation Society suspects her neighbours are involved in a money-making development scam.

The next morning, when Frances Kirby is out for her morning jog, she notices the vintage car they were in up at the airfield, containing Simon Bright's dead body, with Laura nowhere to be seen. Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes. Eventually, the Barnaby family plus Jones make it to a 40s style dance night at the village hall before more villagers start turning up dead.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250617183000 +0000" stop="20250617201700 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When Faith Alexander arrives in Midsomer County to meet her long-lost uncle Rex Masters, she gets a shock - Rex's staff had been told that she was dead.

Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead. Several people soon come forward with multiple wills, which confuse the matter, but when two more people, close friends of Rex, are also murdered, the investigation raises question on the motive, leading Barnaby to wonder if it was down to finances, passion, or something from Rex's past.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250617201700 +0000" stop="20250617220600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Following the death of Alan King while on a business trip to China, the family company, King's Crystal, is in financial trouble.

In addition to strife between members of the family, the factory workers are outraged at the loss of their jobs.

During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large.

There are certainly possible suspects in the murder and attempt on Kirkwood, from Delyth's children, who oppose the engagement, Delyth's husband, and more, as the detectives investigate things, in hopes of uncovering the truth before a major walk is to take place on Mount Snowdon.</desc></programme><channel id="671073"><display-name>Unsolved Mysteries</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/atiqhbFyXEM6rA==/864892f9-3ab0-4950-9f8b-189ec2d92c20/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjdAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="671073" start="20250616011000 +0000" stop="20250616020200 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Corazones Rotos &amp; Actualización, Carro en Llamas &amp; Actualización, Matanzas en Carros Blindados &amp; Actualización y Víctima de Amnesia.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250616020200 +0000" stop="20250616025600 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: El Hombre Que Sabía Demasiado; Actualización: Estafador de Novias, Dante Oscuro &amp; Actualización y La Promesa &amp; Actualización.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250616025600 +0000" stop="20250616035500 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Médico Perdido &amp; Actualización, Actualización: Acosador en Serie, Casanova Asesino &amp; Actualización y Luces de Vancouver.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250616035500 +0000" stop="20250616045600 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Kay Hall &amp; Actualización, Actualización: Gracias Teniente Stevens, Estafa de Monedas, Perrera de Marth, Sarah Jose y Secuestro de Bebé en Baltimore.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250616045600 +0000" stop="20250616055400 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Sonny Liston, Actualización: Arboleda de Langostas, La Búsqueda de Sharon y Secuestro de Campbell.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250616055400 +0000" stop="20250616065400 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: OVNI de Bentwaters (Partes 1 &amp; 2), Calabozos &amp; Dragones y Cambio de Identidad &amp; Actualización.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250616065400 +0000" stop="20250616075500 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Madre Motociclista &amp; Actualización, Actualización: Robo en el Cajero, Pájara Blanco, Muerte con Estricnina y Marineros Perdidos.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250616075500 +0000" stop="20250616085800 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Picos Gemelos Reales &amp; Actualización, Actualización: Corredor de Bebés, Mary y Martha &amp; Actualización y Acosador de Niños en Serie &amp; Actualización.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250616085800 +0000" stop="20250616095300 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Medjugorje, Fuego de Cabaña, Marauqe A para Abducción y Ejecutivo de Banco Perdido.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250616095300 +0000" stop="20250616105100 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Mickey Thompson &amp; Actualización, Escape Peludo &amp; Actualización, Pie Grande, Un Día Lluvioso and Petición de Maine &amp; Actualización.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250616105100 +0000" stop="20250616114700 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: D.B.

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250617221000 +0000" stop="20250617230500
