"I got bit by the musky bug at a young age," he says, and it appears the bug is alive and well. “It drives me to be better, do better, fish longer, work harder, put more into it, do more prep work, to check each and every component. I’m forever and always willing to make ‘one more cast.”</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250521023006 +0000" stop="20250521030001 +0000"><title>Stomping Grounds</title><desc>From country music star Brian Kelley’s big 56’ Sunny Briggs Sportfishing Yacht, to getting caught in a storm aboard a small Hurricane deck boat in the Gulf of Mexico, this episode of Stomping Grounds has host Ryan McVinney exploring boat culture in Florida’s Panhandle region, from the Emerald Coast to The Big Bend and the Forgotten Coast.

La Gondola is stuck in a time-warp with naff Seventies cuisine, bad net curtains and no customers. New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal.

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250522135700 +0000" stop="20250522145500 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>On a country road the crew of Helimed 98 launch a difficult rescue mission to free the elderly driver whose arm is trapped beneath his vehicle.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250522145500 +0000" stop="20250522155200 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>A new homeowner trying to help removal men plunges from a balcony in a freak accident and flying doctor Brian is forced to perform an agonizing procedure to restore blood-flow to his hands.Both choppers are called in to save the life of a cyclist with a brain injury following an accident made worse by his decision not to wear a helmet.

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away.
