But then a new group appeared, more violent and aggressive than their predecessors.  All agents had to go on was a series of chilling phone calls, a mysterious voice, and the threat of more violence.  FBI field offices from New York to Miami coordinated their efforts, determined to catch the vicious killers.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250903175100 +0000" stop="20250903185000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>A California bank manager panics and calls in the FBI after the door to his vault refuses to open.
