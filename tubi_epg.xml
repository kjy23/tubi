Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250525210000 +0000" stop="20250525213000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend: Sunday</title><desc>Breaking news coverage and live video.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250525213000 +0000" stop="20250525220000 +0000"><title>Operation Babylift: The 50 Year Journey</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250525220000 +0000" stop="20250526000000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250526000000 +0000" stop="20250526020000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250526020000 +0000" stop="20250526030000 +0000"><title>Will Reeve: Finding My Father</title><desc>Will Reeve retraces father Christopher Reeve's journey, traveling to the places his father visited 30 years ago, and shares never-before-seen family home videos and photos of his dad at the time.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250526030000 +0000" stop="20250526033000 +0000"><title>ABC World News Tonight With David Muir</title><desc>The latest news from America, as reported by the ABC television network.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250526033000 +0000" stop="20250526040000 +0000"><title>ABC World News Tonight With David Muir</title><desc>The latest news from America, as reported by the ABC television network.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250526040000 +0000" stop="20250526060000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250526060000 +0000" stop="20250526063000 +0000"><title>ABC World News Now</title><desc>Up-to-date information on current events and news from around the world, airing in the overnight hours.

In charge is Executive Chef Philippe, producing everything from all-day breakfasts to hoi sin noodles with an astounding lack of flair; the plastic food is dire and boomerangs back from the dining room as soon as it's cooked.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250525192500 +0000" stop="20250525202700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Chef Gordon Ramsay helps a soul food restaurant owner who can't seem to let her head chef do any of the cooking.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250525202700 +0000" stop="20250525212800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's fourth programme is La Riviera, a fine dining restaurant in Inverness. Owned by multi-millionaire Barry Larson and costing ~£8000 a week to run, the place boasts top French chef Loic Lefebvre and an impeccably-trained kitchen staff with Michelin star-studded backgrounds. Loic is on a mission, to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of haggis, tatties and deep-fried Mars bars. But though he's hungry for success, he's French, he's arrogant and the food's pretentious.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250525212800 +0000" stop="20250525222800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's program is Clubway 41, despite being voted Blackpool Tourist Board Restaurant of the year, the place is dire straits. It is the prime example of HOW NOT TO RUN A RESTAURANT. Owner DAVE is the flakey self-appointed head chef, who hasn't been in a kitchen for 30 years and can't cook. His partner DAWN invents bizarre dishes for the menu, ranging from "tomato and cointreau soup" to "pork with brie, nectarine and whiskey sauce". Gordon faces a hellish week, Clubway 41 is breaking every rule in book, can he bring Dave, Dawn and their food back to earth?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250525222800 +0000" stop="20250525232900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Walnut Tree Inn was in big trouble - there was no head chef, the customers had dwindled, and the owner had been forced to sell the family home to keep the business afloat.
Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250525232900 +0000" stop="20250526003100 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's program Gordon Ramsay travels to the seaside to help ailing hotel and restaurant, The Sandgate.

La Gondola is stuck in a time-warp with naff Seventies cuisine, bad net curtains and no customers. New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal. Can Gordon get the kitchen cooking again and save La Gondala from sinking?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250526013100 +0000" stop="20250526023100 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Two new artists join Sketch, Alice and Paisley to tackle extreme tattoos; Pash gets rid of Ollie's naughty naval tatt, while Uzzi wipes away Brandon's cleaning slip-up; Sketch covers grandad Mick's bold brag; Uzzi tattoos a memorial.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250526023100 +0000" stop="20250526033000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Alice covers Hannah's shocking memorial to her wild-child years; Uzzi takes on Alan's tribute to an R'n'B star; Sketch rids Kaylee of an obscene arm tattoo; Alice creates a design to celebrate Jane's best friend.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250526033000 +0000" stop="20250526043000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Pash whips a dominatrix into shape; Sketch cleans up Alex's ridiculous rhyme; Alice disguises charmer Dean's brag; Uzzi helps Rhys cover up his past desires.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250526043000 +0000" stop="20250526052900 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space; Alice replaces Emma's fishy stinker; Pash erases Matt's not-so-sharp pencil; Morgan's chub rub gets covered with a design that's a bit less sore.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250526052900 +0000" stop="20250526062900 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi rids Stefen of a terrible tribute; Alice lights up Amanda's life; Pash blows away Liam's trumpy tattoo; Sketch faces a not-so-tasty treat.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250526062900 +0000" stop="20250526072800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Sketch gives Andy a hand with his disastrous digits; Alice designs popstar Michelle Heaton something a little special; Pash rids Carly of her cracking calamity; Uzzi works on Ian's booby blunder.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250526072800 +0000" stop="20250526082500 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>Marie ended up being rushed into hospital when surgery to remove excess skin left her with life threatening sepsis.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250526082500 +0000" stop="20250526092300 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>Sue's 'cut price' tummy tuck in Turkey almost killed her and Oli's quest to become a Korean pop star led him to spend £100,000 to look like his Asian idols.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250526092300 +0000" stop="20250526102000 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>A firsthand account of so-called 'Botox Parties'.
