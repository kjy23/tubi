Owner CHARITA JONES was producing a menu of irresistible unique classics from the Deep South, but at the same facing financial disaster. The punters were missing, and so was her business acumen. But Gordon succeeded in shutting her out of the kitchen, getting the chef back on the boil and putting the soul back into the business.

Today Charita is fully-booked round the clock and bursting out of the Soul Shack to take on the 110-seater Momma Cherri's Big House. But expansion brings a different set of challenges, and she's still struggling to control her staff and manage her success. Has she got what it takes to make the next step up, or will she be forced to rethink her grand plans?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602030000 +0000" stop="20250602040000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's penultimate programme Gordon returns to La Riviera - now renamed Abstract - a fine dining restaurant in Inverness. Owned by multi-millionaire Barry Larson and costing ~£8000 a week to run, the place boasted top French chef Loic Lefebvre and an impeccably-trained kitchen staff, all of them on a mission to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of the haggis. But the locals weren't biting and the restaurant was empty most nights. Gordon's recipe for survival forced them to tone down their act and demystify the menu to get the punters in. Today the restaurant's return to form has led to plans for expansion. Loic is still there, and now he's been promoted to Executive Chef he will oversee any new ventures. But can he continue to resist a return to French frills, and has he managed to pull off his own personal ambition, a Michelin star?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602040000 +0000" stop="20250602050000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S01:E06 - Episode 6</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602050000 +0000" stop="20250602060000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S01:E07 - Episode 7</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602060000 +0000" stop="20250602070000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Tonight, for the first time ever on Kitchen Nightmares, Gordon takes on a nightmare restaurant abroad. La Parra de Burriana is an ex-pat restaurant in Nerja on Spain's Costa del Sol. Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602070000 +0000" stop="20250602080000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602080000 +0000" stop="20250602090000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S01:E08 - Episode 8</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602090000 +0000" stop="20250602100000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S02:E01 - Episode 1</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602100000 +0000" stop="20250602110000 +0000"><title>MasterChef</title><desc>The Top 10 home cooks will cook family style when they face their next team challenge and create family style meals for VIP diners.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602110000 +0000" stop="20250602120000 +0000"><title>MasterChef</title><desc>The contestants must prepare a flambe; the challenge winner selects which Southern dish the contestants will cook.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602120000 +0000" stop="20250602130000 +0000"><title>Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Chef Ramsay must whip a family-owned restaurant in Redondo Beach, California back into shape.

Owner CHARITA JONES was producing a menu of irresistible unique classics from the Deep South, but at the same facing financial disaster. The punters were missing, and so was her business acumen. But Gordon succeeded in shutting her out of the kitchen, getting the chef back on the boil and putting the soul back into the business.

Today Charita is fully-booked round the clock and bursting out of the Soul Shack to take on the 110-seater Momma Cherri's Big House. But expansion brings a different set of challenges, and she's still struggling to control her staff and manage her success. Has she got what it takes to make the next step up, or will she be forced to rethink her grand plans?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602030000 +0000" stop="20250602040000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's penultimate programme Gordon returns to La Riviera - now renamed Abstract - a fine dining restaurant in Inverness. Owned by multi-millionaire Barry Larson and costing ~£8000 a week to run, the place boasted top French chef Loic Lefebvre and an impeccably-trained kitchen staff, all of them on a mission to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of the haggis. But the locals weren't biting and the restaurant was empty most nights. Gordon's recipe for survival forced them to tone down their act and demystify the menu to get the punters in. Today the restaurant's return to form has led to plans for expansion. Loic is still there, and now he's been promoted to Executive Chef he will oversee any new ventures. But can he continue to resist a return to French frills, and has he managed to pull off his own personal ambition, a Michelin star?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602040000 +0000" stop="20250602050000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S01:E06 - Episode 6</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602050000 +0000" stop="20250602060000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S01:E07 - Episode 7</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602060000 +0000" stop="20250602070000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Tonight, for the first time ever on Kitchen Nightmares, Gordon takes on a nightmare restaurant abroad. La Parra de Burriana is an ex-pat restaurant in Nerja on Spain's Costa del Sol. Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602070000 +0000" stop="20250602080000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602080000 +0000" stop="20250602090000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S01:E08 - Episode 8</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602090000 +0000" stop="20250602100000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S02:E01 - Episode 1</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602100000 +0000" stop="20250602110000 +0000"><title>MasterChef</title><desc>The Top 10 home cooks will cook family style when they face their next team challenge and create family style meals for VIP diners.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602110000 +0000" stop="20250602120000 +0000"><title>MasterChef</title><desc>The contestants must prepare a flambe; the challenge winner selects which Southern dish the contestants will cook.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250602120000 +0000" stop="20250602130000 +0000"><title>Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Chef Ramsay must whip a family-owned restaurant in Redondo Beach, California back into shape.

boss, Paul Castellano.  The Teflon Don felt secure in his position, always remaining one step ahead of the law.  But he was also the ongoing obsession of Bruce Mouw, leader of an elite crew of FBI agents formed to bring down the Gambino family.  With the help and genius of his Special Projects Squad, bugs were planted in Gotti's most private meeting places.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250602020000 +0000" stop="20250602030000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In 1990 and 1991, Chicago police and the FBI were on the trail of a bank robber whose holdups were becoming increasingly violent.  The criminal consistently used stolen Japanese cars to carry out the robberies, so authorities hoped to identify him by tracking vehicle thefts.  When they finally located the man known as the bearded bandit, they learned that he did not work alone and he had made a pact never to surrender.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250602030000 +0000" stop="20250602040000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>On February 3, 1990, a 14-year-old girl ran away from her mother's home and disappeared without a trace.  Her mother hoped Pasadena, Texas police could find her before it was too late.  Six months later, their worst fear was realized when a farmer discovered the young girl's remains in an Illinois barn.  The FBI was called in to help.  Agents tracked down a trucker who they believed was responsible for 50 more deaths.

An employee believed she recognized the voice of one of the robbers, and FBI agents began conducting surveillance on a former employee of the facility.  With only one piece of physical evidence, a fragment of a vehicle taillight, authorities hoped to connect him to the crime, and locate his accomplices.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250602050000 +0000" stop="20250602060000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In June of 1992, masked bandits pulled off a daring mid-day bank robbery.  It marked the beginning of a four-year crime wave that rocked Seattle.  With each new robbery, the bandits perfected their craft, leaving behind no evidence and escaping with hundreds and thousands of dollars.  As the robbers became increasingly violent, pressure mounted to end their reign.  With few leads, the FBI forced their own luck.  The effort put them face to face with an armed and desperate fugitive.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250602060000 +0000" stop="20250602070000 +0000"><title>Judgment With
