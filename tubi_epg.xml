It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250529121900 +0000" stop="20250529131900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron.

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250529205000 +0000" stop="20250529215100 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's program Gordon Ramsay travels to the seaside to help ailing hotel and restaurant, The Sandgate.
